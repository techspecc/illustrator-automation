# Illustrator Automation Scripts

Two scripts for selecting objects in Adobe Illustrator by size:

- `selectcirclesbyrange.jsx`: Select circles within a diameter range.  
  Usage: Run script, enter min/max diameter (mm or pt).

- `selectobjectsbybounds.jsx`: Select objects by width and height ranges.  
  Usage: Run script, enter min/max width and height (mm or pt).

Ensure your document is open and objects are unlocked and visible before running.
